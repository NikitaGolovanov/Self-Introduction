Hello, in this video I want to talk about myself and my desire to learn programming skills.

My name is Nikita Golovanov, I am 23 years old. After the eleventh grade, I went to study at MOSCOW AUTOMOBILE AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION STATE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY or MADI, a specialty called Automobiles, I studied for two years with good and excellent, but after the fourth passed session, I realized that I did not want to develop in this area.

The realization that I would have to spend a few more years studying something that I was not interested in pushed me to the decision to leave the university. Since school, I was interested in programming in addition to the engineering direction, but due to the lack of quality education in this direction, I chose engineering.

But now, I have many friends in this field, I'm interested in it and I decided to try it. I started with literally zero knowledge. But after studying at the zero course and reading a lot of information, I was able to join the 1st course and everything that is happening now, gaining new skills, practical application of what I learned in the materials provided by the course, I really like all this, although sometimes it is quite difficult. But this complexity does not cause bad emotions, because in the end you still come to a decision, and at this moment you get such pleasure that you forget about all the difficulties.

I donâ€™t have any projects as such, since I started completely from scratch. All projects made by me are only those that I did while studying here on the course. I feel extremely motivated and ready to work hard. Thank you for your attention
